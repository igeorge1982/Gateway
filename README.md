Note on iOS build:
- You must run POD install to install the pods into your local environment. AFNetwork is an Objective-C dependency that is supposed to be re-installed as the official Objective-C class bridging into Swift code describes it, if any problem occurs. 
- Take care of the App Transport Security Exceptions: it needs to be set accordingly
- If you use self-signed certs with the server, you must install your custom cerificate authority file onto your device.
